            <p id="first-para">I smelled something funny when I was getting ready for work one day. I followed the smell
                to the kitchen,
                where I found that my cat had turned on my gas stove and was standing over the burner huffing the fumes.
                Needless to say, I was forced to remove the knobs from my stove, and only put them on when I need to use
                it.</p>

            <p id="second-para">Dogs have always gotten all the glory. There are books written about them, parks devoted
                to them, and
                they're known as "man's best friend," for goodness sake. But more recently, cats are coming into their
                own. Saddled with a bad rap for being cold and icy for years, more and more people are coming around to
                the furry felines. Maybe it's thanks to Instagram where cute photos of cats (and funny "cat-ch" phrases
                and captions) have helped turn the tide. Perhaps it's the prospect of naming a fancy cat something like
                Broccoli or Lord Puddington. It could be that more folks have been mesmerized watching a cat play a game
                or play on a cat treeâ€”more fun than a day at the dog park, and you don't have to throw a ball a single
                time.</p>
